Compilation
Preconditions:
premake4 and cmake has to be installed.
“lib” and “shared” folders have to be in the same directory as A3 folder

Navigate to the A3 directory.

To Compile run the following commands:
premake4 gmake
make

To run the program run the following command:
./A3 Assets/puppet.lua

Tested the assignment on gl17.student.cs in the graphics lab.

Manual
Everything is implemented according to the assignment specifications.

Additional Notes:
Sometimes the program renders the puppets arms and legs with weird angles and all
distorted (i have no idea why). If that happens, close the program and run again.
This happens on most of the lab machines except for gl17 where the occurrence is low.


Puppet Model:

The puppet model is a hierarchical scene graph.

The root of the graph points to torso which is essentially the root of the whole puppet.
The puppet consists of the basic anatomical features of a human.
Each selectable geometry has a joint node as its immediate parent.
The joint node’s immediate parent is a sphere mesh representing the joint.

The selectable geometries are:
Left/Right
	upper arm
	fore arm
	hand
	thigh
	calf
	foot
neck
head
