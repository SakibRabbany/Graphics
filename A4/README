Compilation
Preconditions:
premake4 and cmake has to be installed.
“lib” and “shared” folders have to be in the same directory as A4 folder

Navigate to the A4 directory.

To Compile run the following commands:
premake4 gmake
make

To run the program run the following command:
./A4 <path to lua script>

Tested the assignment on gl10.student.cs in the graphics lab.

Features:
- Reflection
- Glossy Reflection
- Refraction
- Glossy refraction
- Adaptive Antialias
- Primitives (cone and cylinder)
- Softshadows (dependant on light)
- Texture Mapping (dependant on if the texture is set to the geometry)

Additional Notes:
- By default all features are turned on.
- If Antialias is turned on, adaptive antialias will not work. It is either or.
- You can go into A4.cpp and toggle the options that are defined by the macros.
	You have to make the program after.
- Lua scripts that display the implemented features are in the Submission folder
	along with the renderings of each of the scripts.

Modifications:
- gr.area_light({x, y, z}, {r, g, b}, {c1, c2, c3}, r) : creates an area light 
							(z - plane aligned) with radius r
- gr.set_material(ks, ks, shininess, glossy_coefficient, refractive_index) : where 								glossy_coefficient is a vec4 where
							x -> reflectance
							y -> relfective glossy coefficient
							z -> refractance
							w -> refractance glossy coefficient
- gr.set_texture("filename"): the texture file (has to be png)
